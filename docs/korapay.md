API Keys
To enable communication between your application and Korapay, you'll need your API Keys. Kora authenticates every request your application makes with these keys. Generally, every account comes with two sets of API keys - public and secret API keys for Test and Live modes.

Your public keys are non-sensitive identifiers that can be used on the client-side of your application. By design, public keys cannot modify any part of your account besides initiating transactions for you. Your secret keys, on the other hand, are to be kept secret and confidential. They are required for accessing any financial data and can be used to make any API call on your account. Your secret keys should never be shared on any client-side code. Treat them like any other password. And, if for any reason you believe your secret key has been compromised simply reset them by generating new keys. You can generate new API keys from your dashboard.

Obtaining your API Keys
Your API keys are always available on your dashboard. To find your API keys,

Login to your dashboard.
Navigate to Settings on the side menu.
Go to the API Configuration tab on the Settings page.
In the Korapay APIs section, you‚Äôd see both your Public and Secret keys, and a button to Generate New API Keys.
üöß
The API keys in test mode are different from the API keys in Live mode. So you need to always ensure that you do not misuse the keys when you switch between modes.

Generating new API Keys
You should always keep your API keys safe and protect your account. However, in the event where your API keys have been compromised, you can easily generate new API keys. Simply click the 'Generate New API Keys' button under the API Configuration tab on the Settings page.


Once you generate new API keys, the old keys become void - you can no longer use them to make API calls. Make sure to update your application to use the newly generated keys.

Testing your Integration
It is important to test your integration before going live to make sure it works properly. That‚Äôs why we created test bank accounts, mobile money numbers and test cards for you to simulate different payment scenarios as you integrate with Kora.

Testing Payouts to Bank Accounts
Use the following bank accounts to test these scenarios for your Bank Transfer payout integration:

Scenario	Currency	Bank Code	Account Number
Successful Payout	NGN	033	0000000000
Failed Payout	NGN	035	0000000000
Error: Invalid Account	NGN	011	9999999999
Successful Payout	KES	0068	000000000000
Failed Payout	KES	0053	000000000000
Testing Payouts to Mobile Money
Use the following mobile money details to test these scenarios for your Mobile Money payout integration:

Webhooks
Webhooks provide a way to receive notifications for your transactions in real time. While your transaction is being processed, its status progresses until it is completed. This makes it very important to get the final status for that transaction, and that's where webhooks are very beneficial.

Put simply, a webhook URL is an endpoint on your server that can receive API requests from Korapay‚Äôs server. Note that the request is going to be an HTTP POST request.

Setting your Webhook URL
You can specify your webhook URL in the API Configuration tab of the Settings page of your dashboard. Make sure that the webhook URL is unauthenticated and publicly available.


The request to the webhook URL comes with a payload, and this payload contains the details of the transaction for which you are being notified.

Webhook Notification Request Payload Definitions
Field	Data Type	Description
event	String	transfer.success, transfer.failed, charge.success or charge.failed, refund.success, refund.failed
data	Object	The object containing transaction details: amount, fee, currency, status, reference
data.amount	Number	Transaction amount
data.fee	Number	Transaction fee
data.currency	String	Transaction currency
data.status	String	Transaction status. This can be success or failed.
data.reference	String	Transaction reference. This reference can be used to query the transaction

Sample Webhook Notification Payloads
Single Payout
Bulk Payout
Pay-in (NG Virtual Bank Account)
Pay-in (Cards, Bank Transfer, Mobile Money)
Refunds

/*
* Applicable Events: "transfer.success", "transfer.failed"
*/
{
  "event": "transfer.success",
  "data": {
    "fee": 15,
    "amount": 150.99,
    "status": "success",
    "currency": "NGN",
    "reference": "Z78EYMAUBQ5"
  }
}

Verifying a Webhook Request
It is important to verify that requests are coming from Korapay to avoid delivering value based on a counterfeit request. To verify our requests, you need to validate the signature assigned to the request.
Valid requests are sent with a header x-korapay-signature which is essentially an HMAC SHA256 signature of ONLY the data object in response payload signed using your secret key.

JavaScript
Java
PHP

const crypto = require(‚Äúcrypto‚Äù);
const secretKey = sk_live_******

router.post(‚Äò/your_webhook_url‚Äô, (req, res, next) => {
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey).update(JSON.stringify(req.body.data)).digest('hex');

   If (hash === req.headers[‚Äòx-korapay-signature‚Äô]) {
     // Continue with the request functionality
   } else {
     // Don‚Äôt do anything, the request is not from us.
   }
});
Responding to a Webhook Request
It is important to respond to the requests with a 200 status code to acknowledge that you have received the requests. Korapay does not pay attention to any request parameters apart from the request status code.

Please note that if any other response code is received, or there‚Äôs a timeout while sending the request, we retry the request periodically within 72 hours after which retries stop.

Resending a Webhook via the Kora Dashboard
For every transaction, Kora sends a webhook notification to the merchant‚Äôs configured webhook URL. If the transaction status is Pending/Failed, the ‚ÄòResend Webhook‚Äô button becomes activated on the dashboard, allowing you to manually trigger the webhook notification again.

Conditions for Resending Webhooks
For Payouts

When channel is api and status is successful or failed.
For Pay-ins

When channel is api and status is successful or failed.
When channel is modal and status is successful.
How to Resend a Webhook Notification on a Transaction
On your Kora Dashboard, navigate to the Webhook / Metadata section of the transaction's detail.
Locate the webhook notification for the transaction in question.
If the status is Pending/Failed, the Resend Webhook button will be displayed in the top-right corner.
Click the Resend Webhook button to manually trigger a new webhook notification. Be sure that you need to resend the webhook to avoid duplicate transactions on your end.
The webhook request will be reattempted and the updated status can be reviewed in the dashboard.

Best Practices
It is recommended to do the following when receiving webhook notifications from us:

Keep track of all notifications received: It‚Äôs important to keep track of all notifications you‚Äôve received. When a new notification is received proceed to check that this has not been processed before giving value. A retry of already processed notifications can happen if we do not get a 200 HTTP Status code from your notification URL, or if there was a request time out.
Acknowledge receipt of notifications with a 200 HTTP status code: It‚Äôs recommended you immediately acknowledge receipt of the notification by returning a 200 HTTP Status code before proceeding to perform other logics, failure to do so might result in a timeout which would trigger a retry of such notification.

Payout Errors
Errors that occur before the Payout is initiated
Unable to resolve bank account.
This error occurs when our system is unable to successfully validate a customer‚Äôs bank account to determine if it‚Äôs valid or not. This can be treated as a failed withdrawal.

While for Ghana we support; MTN Momo and Airtel Tigo. For Cameroon and Ivory Coast we support both MTN and Orange. Here are some test mobile money numbers we created to help you simulate different scenarios for mobile money payments as you integrate.

    "currency": "GHS",
    "reference": "idkMain27105551011",
    "description": "Payment for a emilokan",
    "notification_url": "https://webhook.site/1c209942-1a66-4cdf-a7ab-78d9cc684ad2",
    "redirect_url": "https://webhook.site",
    "customer": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "John@yahoo.com"
    },
    "merchant_bears_cost": true,
    "mobile_money": {
      "number": "254700000000"
    }
}
To charge the number make a POST request with the payload to our charge mobile money endpoint. Ensure to include the relevant country currency.

Endpoint - POST https://api.korapay.com/merchant/api/v1/charges/mobile-money

If the request is successful, you should receive a message with either OTP or STK_PROMPT as the auth model.

Sample OTP Auth Response:

JSON

{
    "status": true,
    "code": "AA001",
    "message": "Authorization required",
    "data": {
        "amount": 701,
        "amount_expected": 701,
        "currency": "GHS",
        "fee": 1.87,
        "vat": 0.13,
        "auth_model": "OTP",
        "transaction_reference": "KPY-PAY-rYF4c5ZWioeb",
        "payment_reference": "idkMain27105551021",
        "status": "processing",
        "narration": "Payment for a emilokan",
        "message": "Token generated and sent out successfully",
        "mobile_money": {
            "number": "+254700000000"
        },
        "customer": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "John@yahoo.com"
        }
    }
}
Sample STK_PROMPT Auth Response:

JSON

{  
    "status": true,  
    "code": "AA001",  
    "message": "Authorization required",  
    "data": {  
        "amount": 10,  
        "amount_expected": 10,  
        "currency": "KES",  
        "fee": 0.25,  
        "vat": 0.04,  
        "auth_model": "STK_PROMPT",  
        "transaction_reference": "KPY-PAY-rYF4c5ZWioeb",  
        "payment_reference": "KPY-PAY-79lsPQSqHXSz",  
        "status": "processing",  
        "narration": "Live Test Link",  
        "message": "You will receive a pin prompt on your mobile number +25470000000 for GHS 10. Kindly enter your wallet PIN to authorize the payment",  
        "mobile_money": {  
            "number": "254700000000"  
        },  
        "customer": {  
            "name": "John Doe",  
            "email": "John@yahoo.com"
        }  
    }  
}
Step 2: Authorize mobile money transaction
The next step is based on the auth model returned in the previous response after initiating the charge. There are 2 ways of authorizing a transaction OTP and STK_PROMPT.

Authorizing an OTP transaction
After making the request to charge the number, if the status of the transaction is processing and auth_model is OTP, this means an OTP has been sent to the wallet owner's phone. You would need to collect the OTP in order to authorize the transaction.

Collect the OTP sent to the customer‚Äôs phone and make a request to our authorize endpoint with the OTP and the transaction reference.

Endpoint - https://api.korapay.com/merchant/api/v1/charges/mobile-money/authorize

Authorize OTP transaction

curl --location 'https://api.korapay.com/merchant/api/v1/charges/mobile-money/authorize' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KORAPAY_SECRET_KEY' \
--data '{
    "reference": "KPY-PAY-rYF4c5ZWioeb",
    "token": "123456"
}'
-X POST
If the OTP verification is successful, an STK prompt will be sent to the wallet owner's phone for him to enter his PIN.

Sample response

Valid OTP
Invalid OTP

{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Authorization required",
    "data": {
        "amount": "10.00",
        "amount_expected": "10.00",
        "currency": "GHS",
        "fee": 1.75,
        "vat": 0.12,
        "auth_model": "STK_PROMPT",
        "transaction_reference": "KPY-PAY-rYF4c5ZWioeb",
        "payment_reference": "KPY-PAY-rYF4c5ZWioeb",
        "status": "processing",
        "message": "You will receive a prompt on mobile number. Kindly enter your wallet PIN to authorize the payment",
        "mobile_money": {
            "number": "+254700000000"
        }
    }
}
Authorizing an STK transaction
After making the request to charge/authorize the number, if the status of the transaction is processing and auth_model is STK, this means an STK has been sent to the wallet owner's phone.

Step 3: Verify Payment
The final step after receiving payment is to ensure that the payment was successful by making a verification request to our verification charge endpoint. The reference here should be your transaction reference.

Here's a sample request and response for verifying a mobile money payment:

cURL

curl https://api.korapay.com/merchant/api/v1/charges/:reference
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KORAPAY_SECRET_KEY"
-X GET
Sample response for a successful transaction:

Successful Payment Response
Failed Payment Response

{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Charge retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "reference": "KPY-PAY-rYF4c5ZWioeb",
    "status": "success",
    "amount": "10.00",
    "amount_paid": 0,
    "fee": 0.29,
    "currency": "GHS",
    "description": "Payment for a emilokan",
    "mobile_money": {
      "number": "+254700000000"
    },
    "customer": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "John@yahoo.com"
    }
  }
}
Step 4: Setup Webhook
You can set your application to receive a confirmation via webhooks when a mobile money payment is successful. Please visit Webhooks to see more information about the webhook request body and how to verify and handle the webhook request.

Here's what the response could look like:

Success Response
Failure Response

{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Refund successfully initiated",
    "data": {
        "refund_reference": "TXN-123456",
        "refund_date": "2025-04-03T08:27:22.646Z",
        "status": "processing",
        "payment_reference": "TXN-234,
        "reason": "Customer requested refund",
        "amount_returned": 120,
        "currency": "NGN"
    }
}

For the webhooks, here's how the response could look like at initiation:

Successful Initiation Webhook Response
Failed Initiation Webhook Response

{
   "event": "refund.success",
   "data": {
       "amount": 100,
       "status": "success",
       "status_reason": "success test transaction",
       "currency": "NGN",
       "reference": "TXN-123456",
       "payment_reference": "TXN-1",

Overview
Your Balance on Korapay simply represents how much funds you have in your Korapay account. Funds must first be available in your Balance before you can successfully make payouts, and these funds get into your Balance through Pay-ins - funding instructions (top-ups) and settled payments received from your customers. You can either check your dashboard or use the Balance API to get up-to-the-minute data on available funds and your current positions with Korapay.

Getting balance information can be useful for reconciliatory purposes, preventing failures from insufficient funds, or even fraud detection.

Available and Pending Balances
As the name suggests, your available balance represents funds that are available and ready for you to use - to withdraw or to make payouts. This available balance increases when you top up your balance or receive a settlement for your pay-ins in your balance.

Your pending balance, on the other hand, refers to funds that have been received but are yet to be settled to you. Payments received from your customers are settled to you based on the settlement schedule of your account. Once you‚Äôve been settled, your pending balance is affected as funds become available for use.

3024
Here's an illustration of how your pending balance works. Let‚Äôs say your available balance is NGN5,000 and your pending balance is NGN0, for example. If your customer successfully pays NGN2,500 to you, your available balance remains NGN5,000 while your pending balance becomes NGN2,500. Once your settlement schedule is due, funds are moved from your pending balance to your available balance. Your available balance then becomes NGN7,500.

üöß
Note that if your settlement destination has been set to your bank account, funds in your pending balance go right into the bank account you set, and not into your available balance.
Funding your Balance
To make funds readily available for your payouts, you can conveniently fund your balance right from your dashboard. One way to fund your balance is by making a transfer to your Reserved Bank Account (RBA), a special type of bank account attached to your Korapay account that is exclusively reserved for funding your balance.

3024
To fund your balance:

Go to the Balances page of your dashboard.
In the Balance Detail box, click the ‚ÄòAdd Funds‚Äô button.
The details of your Reserved Bank Account will be displayed on the funding pop up. Make a bank transfer to the account and your balance will be funded.
Exporting your Balance History
Your balance history shows the record of debit and credit transactions that make up your available balance. Businesses find this record very useful for reconciliation purposes - you can use it to check if your balances and transactions add up correctly. Korapay also gives you the option to export this record in a preferred format (CSV or Excel) for transactions within any timeframe of your choice. Aside from the amount of the credit or debit transactions, this record also provides information on the balance before and after each transaction.

To export your Balance History, click the ‚ÄòExport‚Äô button in the Balance Detail box on your Balances page. Select your preferred export format, choose a date range, and the table columns to be shown in the export.

Note that pending or processing transactions do not affect your balance.

Retrieve your balance information with the Balance API

Balance API is Kora‚Äôs product for receiving real-time Balance information. This real-time Balance data can be helpful, for example, when checking to see if your account has sufficient funds before using it as a funding source for a payout. With the Balance API, you can easily access your balance without having to log into your dashboard. It also provides you with the liberty and flexibility to incorporate your Korapay Balance into your application however you deem fit.


Balance Request
This endpoint returns your Korapay balances (available and pending) and requires secret key authentication.

Endpoint: Request Balance

{{baseurl}}/merchant/api/v1/balances

Response
The Balance API automatically returns both the available and pending balances across all supported currencies in the response. By default, balances are provided for NGN, but merchants with multi-currency accounts will also receive balances for other supported currencies, including USD, GHS, KES, XAF, XOF and ZAR.

Here's a sample response:

Sample Response

{
    "status": true,
    "message": "success",
    "data": {
  			"NGN": {
            "pending_balance": 100000.78,
            "available_balance": 400300.90
        },
        "USD": {
            "pending_balance": 10000.78,
            "available_balance": 10093756.06,
            "issuing_balance": 17639.67
        }

from_currency	String	The currency from which the user is converting. For example, if you wanted to convert Nigerian Naira to US Dollar, the from_currency will be NGN.
to_currency	String	The currency to which the user wants to convert funds. For example, if you wanted to convert Nigerian Naira to US Dollar, the to_currency will be USD.
amount	Number	The amount to be converted (referring to the from_currency).

  "status": true,
  "message": "Conversion rate retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "from_currency": "USD",
    "to_currency": "NGN",
    "from_amount": 10,
    "to_amount": 14400,

Dynamic Currency Conversion
Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) is a real-time conversion service that allows your customers to pay in their local currency while you get settled in your preferred currency. This offers a seamless and familiar checkout experience for your customers.

Here's how Dynamic Currency Conversion works:

Kora converts transaction amount: Our system automatically converts the transaction amount to the customer's local currency using the real-time exchange rate.
Customer makes payment: The customer sees the total amount in their local currency and proceeds to make the payment.
Transaction processed: The payment is processed as usual, with the settlement amount converted back to your preferred settlement currency.

Getting Started with Dynamic Currency Conversions
To get started with DCC, follow these steps:

First, you need access to the Currency Conversions service. See here.

Once you have access to Currency Conversions,

Go to Settings > Settlements
Select the currency for which you want to set this conversions setting (Swap Settlements), and check the "Allow this merchant to settle payments in another currency" checkbox.
Save changes to enable your preference to take effect.

Initiate a DCC transaction and include the following additional parameters in your payment request:

payment_currency: The currency that the customer pays in (their local currency).
settlement_currency: The currency in which you want to receive settlement.

Here's an example of a request initiating a DCC transaction:

Sample Request

{
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "payment_currency": "NGN",
    "settlement_currency": "USD",
    "reference": "your-transaction-reference-001",
    "narration": "Payment for product Y",
    "channels": "card",
    "default_channel": "card",
    "customer": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@email.com"
    },
    "notification_url": "https://webhook.site/8d321d8d-397f-4bab-bf4d-7e9ae3afbd50",
    "metadata":{
        "key0": "test0"
    }
}

The responses to this request would look like this:

Sample Response

{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Charge created successfully",
    "customer": {
        "reference": "your-transaction-reference-001",
        "checkout_url": "https://checkout.korapay.com/KPY-PI-202501231hXn08399/pay"
    }
}

Some important things to note:

The currency field should indicate the currency of the amount sent for collection.
Both payment_currency and settlement_currency must be supported by Kora.
The exchange rate can be marked up in the settlement settings on the dashboard.

If you have any questions or feedback on currency conversions, kindly email our support team at support@korapay.com.

Testing Conversions on the Sandbox Environment
You can test Currency Conversions in our easy-to-use sandbox environment before integrating the live APIs. We recommend performing these tests to ensure a seamless integration of the service.

In the sandbox environment, you can simulate the following experiences;

Get exchange rate
Initiate currency conversion
Get conversion transaction
Fetch conversion transaction history
To test the Currency Conversion product on the sandbox environment, you need to switch your Kora dashboard to test mode and access your test secret key in the API configurations section. Use the test secret key for authorization instead of your live secret key.
