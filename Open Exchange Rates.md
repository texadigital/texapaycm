API Introduction
Open Exchange Rates provides a simple, lightweight and portable JSON API with live and historical foreign exchange (forex) rates, via a simple and easy-to-integrate API, in JSON format. Data are tracked and blended algorithmically from multiple reliable sources, ensuring fair and unbiased consistency.

Exchange rates published through the Open Exchange Rates API are collected from multiple reliable providers, blended together and served up in JSON format for everybody to use. There are no complex queries, confusing authentication methods or long-term contracts.

End-of-day rates are available historically for all days going back to 1st January, 1999.

Common Use Cases
Data from the Open Exchange Rates API are suitable for use in every framework, language and application, and have been successfully integrated in:

Shopping carts from WooCommerce to Shopify, and thousands of individual web stores
Overseas campaigns from the smallest startups to Fortune 500 heavyweights
Accounting departments for multinational brands and shipping/logistics firms
Open source projects and charities
Enterprise-level analytics software
Hundreds of smartphone, tablet and desktop apps
School and university research projects across the world
Our clients range from freelancers and the smallest one-man development shops, to international sports networks and post-IPO startups.

Connecting To The API
We serve our data in JSON format via a simple URL-based interface over HTTPS, which enables you to use the rates in whichever way you require.

This is the high-level introduction ‚Äì for more in-depth guides, please see the relevant Documentation sections.

Connection Types

Any language or software that can make HTTP requests or fetch web addresses can access our API (for example, you can visit any of the API routes in your browser to verify they‚Äôre working as expected).

For your integration, you can use whichever library you require. This will vary depending on your development environment. There are guides and a wide range of open source integrations available, also covered in our documentation.

URLs (routes) are requested once over HTTPS, and deliver all their data in one go, just like a normal web request.

We do not currently support websockets, webhooks or any other keep-alive or push-notification style connections ‚Äì in other words, when you want fresh data, you simply request it from our server. We're considering these methods for a future version of our API, so please email us if interested.

URL Format

The API base path is https://openexchangerates.org/api/.

API routes/endpoints are then appended to this base path, like so:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/
                                  latest.json
                                  currencies.json
                                  historical/2013-02-16.json
Query parameters (such as your App ID, requested base currency, or JSONP callback) are appended as GET request parameters, for example:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
                                             ?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
                                             &base=GBP
                                             &callback=someCallbackFunction
If your request is valid and permitted, you will receive a JSON-formatted response to work with. If something is wrong with the request, you will receive an error message.

API Response Formats
Responses are delivered over HTTPS as plain-text JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, ready to be used however your integration requires.

This format doesn't limit how and where you can use the data in any way: JSON is simply a fast, simple and lightweight delivery mechanism, which is supported in every major language and framework.

We designed these responses to be simple to integrate into a variety of apps and software. If needed, you can also programmatically convert JSON data to CSV/spreadsheet format, or any other format.

There are several main response styles/formats: latest/historical rates, currencies list, time-series and currency conversion. These are detailed individually on each relevant documentation page, and you can see an example (for latest.json) below.

Here's an example basic API request for all the latest rates, relative to USD (default):

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
When requesting this URL (assuming your App ID is valid) you will receive a JSON object containing a UNIX timestamp (UTC seconds), base currency (3-letter ISO code), and a rates object with symbol:value pairs, relative to the requested base currency:

JSON - latest.json

{
    disclaimer: "https://openexchangerates.org/terms/",
    license: "https://openexchangerates.org/license/",
    timestamp: 1449877801,
    base: "USD",
    rates: {
        AED: 3.672538,
        AFN: 66.809999,
        ALL: 125.716501,
        AMD: 484.902502,
        ANG: 1.788575,
        AOA: 135.295998,
        ARS: 9.750101,
        AUD: 1.390866,
        /* ... */
    }
}
The response format is the same for Historical Data (historical/YYYY-MM-DD.json) requests.

Other API routes ‚Äì i.e. currencies.json, time-series.json and convert/ ‚Äì have a different request and response format. Please see their relevant pages for details and examples.
Authentication
The Open Exchange Rates API currently supports basic App ID authentication via the app_id parameter.

App IDs are 32 hexadecimal (0-9/A-F) characters long, and are unique to each account.

üìò
API Explorer
If you have an App ID already, you can enter it into the API Explorer in the API endpoint documentation pages to have it pre-filled and sent with your test requests.

Use the 'Key' icon and enter it next to app_id.

Register for an App ID
You can sign up here for your App ID.

If you've already signed up, you can visit your account dashboard at any time to view your App ID.

Using Your App ID
To access any of the API routes, simply append your App ID as a parameter on the end of each request, like so:

HTTP
cURL

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
Most code samples, extensions, plugins and libraries built for our API have a setting or variable where you can enter your App ID.

App IDs should be kept as secret as possible, but if you're developing in client-side JavaScript, your App ID will be visible in your public source code. We haven't found this to be an issue, but we're working on more advanced authentication for the next version of the API. If you suspect somebody is using your App ID without your permission, we can regenerate it for you.

HTTP Header Authentication
If you do not wish to specify your App ID in the URL parameters, you may instead provide it as a Token in the HTTP Authorization Header. For example:

HTTP
cURL

"Authorization: Token YOUR_APP_ID"
Please note: The format of the HTTP header must be exactly as above (replacing YOUR_APP_ID with a valid Open Exchange Rates App ID). The App ID should be unquoted. If both HTTP header and URL parameter are provided, we will use the value from the URL and ignore the header.

Tracking App ID Usage
To track the usage of your App ID, you can log in to your account dashboard and visit the Usage Statistics page.

You can also use our usage.json API endpoint to request general usage and quota information about an Open Exchange Rates App ID.

üëç
If your account usage goes over the monthly threshold for your plan, we'll email you to discuss options that would best suit your current usage.
Regenerating Your App ID
If you need to create or deactivate an App ID, please visit your Account Dashboard.

Errors
The Open Exchange Rates API will return JSON error messages if something goes wrong, to help you debug your applications and raise alerts.

All Open Exchange Rates API errors currently use the same format.

Here's an example, produced when an invalid app_id is provided:

/latest.json
get
https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
Get the latest exchange rates available from the Open Exchange Rates API.

The most simple route in our API, latest.json provides a standard response object containing all the conversion rates for all of the currently available symbols/currencies, labeled by their international-standard 3-letter ISO currency codes.

The latest rates will always be the most up-to-date data available on your plan.

Log in to see full request history
time	status	user agent	
Make a request to see history.

The base property provides the 3-letter currency code to which all the delivered exchange rates are relative. This base currency is also given in the rates object by default (e.g. "USD": 1).

The rates property is an object (hash/dictionary/associative array) containing all the conversion or exchange rates for all of the available (or requested) currencies, labeled by their international-standard 3-letter currency codes. All the values are relative to 1 unit of the requested base currency.

The timestamp property indicates the time (UNIX) that the rates were published. (If you‚Äôre using the timestamp value in JavaScript, remember to multiply it by 1000, because JavaScript uses time in milliseconds instead of seconds.)

üìò
Additional Parameters
Choosing specific symbols and fetching extra rates with show_alternative are available for all plans, including free. Changing the base currency is available for all clients of paid plans.

/historical/*.json
get
https://openexchangerates.org/api/historical/:date.json
Get historical exchange rates for any date available from the Open Exchange Rates API, currently going back to 1st January 1999.

Like latest.json, our /historical/ route provides a standard response object containing all the conversion rates for all available symbols/currencies on your requested date, labeled by their international-standard 3-letter ISO currency codes.

The historical rates returned are the last values we published for a given UTC day (up to and including 23:59:59 UTC), except for the current UTC date.

üìò
Additional Parameters
Changing the base currency and requesting specific symbols are currently available for clients on the Developer, Enterprise and Unlimited plans.

üöß
Historical Timezones & Daylight Saving Time
For the sake of consistency, all dates and timestamps in the Open Exchange Rates API refer to the UTC timezone (i.e. GMT+00:00), with no daylight saving applied.

If your server/integration operates in a different timezone (or supports multiple timezones), you should convert your server's local time to the equivalent UTC time before making your request.

üöß
Historical requests for the current day's UTC date
Historical rates are generally the last values we published on a given UTC day (up to and including 23:59:59 UTC), with the exception of the current UTC date.

If you make a request for the current day's historical file, you will receive the most recent rates available for your subscription plan at that moment, as the day is not yet complete (therefore in such cases, the values returned would be the same as you would find via our latest.json endpoint).

This behaviour was added early on in response to client feedback, because the historical endpoint aims to always provide a value for a valid date (even if that date is the same as today's date and therefore no end-of-day values are available).

If you wish to obtain rates for a historical date that is the same as today's date (in UTC), you may prefer to make use of the latest.json endpoint instead, in order to prevent unexpected behaviour.

Basic Code Samples
jQuery
Others...

var date = "2010-10-10";

$.get('https://openexchangerates.org/api/historical/' + date + '.json', {app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID'}, function(data) {

Important
The maximum query period currently allowed is one month. If you need more than one month‚Äôs data, please request months sequentially (details below).

With a full list of currencies for each requested day, Time-Series API responses can be very large in size. For better performance, use the symbols parameter to cut down response weight.

The Time Series response format is different from the standard API response as in latest.json. Please familiarise yourself with the standard API response format before using this endpoint.

The start_date is the first day of the time series, and the end_date is the final day (both inclusive).

The base property provides the 3-letter currency code to which all the delivered exchange rates are relative. This base currency is also given in the rates object by default (e.g. "USD": 1).

The rates property is an object of dates, each an object containing the conversion or exchange rates for the specified date, labeled by their international-standard 3-letter currency codes. All the values are relative to 1 unit of the requested base currency.

There is notimestamp property in this response.

Important notes about Time-Series queries
Please note that each day requested counts as one API request (so requesting a full month of data will count as up to 31 ‚Äòhits‚Äô).
Where the requested end date is not a valid calendar date, it will be corrected backwards automatically to the nearest valid day. For example, 2012-02-31 will be corrected to 2012-02-29.
To request multiple months sequentially, you can simply request the 1st to the 31st of each month, regardless of month length.

Periods of 1mo must be aligned to the start of a whole calendar month (i.e. YYYY-MM-01T00:00:00Z)
The requested combination of start_time and period must not produce an end_time that is in the future (i.e. an incomplete period).
üöß
Important
With a full list of currencies, OHLC responses can be very large in size. For better performance, use the symbols parameter to cut down response weight, and set prettyprint=false to remove whitespace.

API Response Format
The OHLC endpoint response format is similar to the standard API response in latest.json. Please familiarise yourself with the standard API response format before using this endpoint.

The start_time is the ISO-8601 formatted timestamp (UTC) of the start of period, corresponding to the 'open' rate.

The end_time is the ISO-8601 formatted timestamp (UTC) of the end of period (inclusive), corresponding to the 'close' rate. (For example, a period of 60m would begin on hh:00:00 and end on hh:59:59).

The base property provides the 3-letter currency code to which all the delivered exchange rates are relative.

The rates object contains an object for each currency in the result set, labelled by its international-standard 3-letter currency code. Each object contains five values:

open ‚Äì The midpoint rate recorded at start_time
high ‚Äì The highest midpoint rate recorded at any time during the period
low ‚Äì The lowest midpoint rate recorded at any time during the period
close ‚Äì The midpoint rate recorded at end_time
average ‚Äì The time-weighted average midpoint exchange rate for the entire period
All the values are relative to 1 unit of the requested base currency.

Set Base Currency ('base')

Set Base Currency ('base')
The default base currency of the API is US Dollars (USD), but you can request exchange rates relative to a different base currency, where available, by setting the base parameter in your request.

üìò
Changing Base Currency is currently available for clients on the Developer, Enterprise and Unlimited plans.

Any currency can be chosen as a base currency when requesting the latest rates, as well as historical rates and time-series (where available).

The base currency should be requested with its 3-digit ISO code (see our list of available API currencies if in doubt).

Results will be delivered relative to 1 unit of the currency you have requested.

Basic Request & Response*
Append the base query parameter to your API request, along with the required 3-digit ISO currency code or symbol, like so (for Euros):

HTTP
jQuery

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=[[app:app_id]]
    &base=EUR
The response format is exactly the same as the standard API response, with all rates in the rates object given relative to 1 standard unit of your requested base currency:

JSON

{
    disclaimer: "https://openexchangerates.org/terms/",
    license: "https://openexchangerates.org/license/",
    "timestamp": 1424127600,
    "base": "EUR",
    "rates": {
        "AED": 4.626447,
        "AFN": 61.002415,
        "ALL": 137.92617,
        /* ... */
    }
}
Basic Code Samples
jQuery
Others...

$.get('https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json', {app_id: '[[app:app_id]]', base: 'UGX'}, function(data) {
    console.log("1 Ugandan Shilling equals " + data.rates.JPY + " Japanese Yen");
});
Combining Parameters
Requesting symbols for a specific base currency can be combined with other API parameters, such as requesting specific rates/currencies (symbols) and JSONP callbacks (callback), for example:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/historical/2015-02-16.json
    ?app_id=[[app:app_id]]
    &base=CAD
    &symbols=AUD,GBP,EUR
    &callback=someFunctionName
The response will combine your parameters:

JSON

someFunctionName(
{
    disclaimer: "https://openexchangerates.org/terms/",
    license: "https://openexchangerates.org/license/",
    timestamp: 1424127600,
    base: "CAD",
    rates: {
            AUD: 1.032828,
            EUR: 0.706867,
            GBP: 0.522328,
        }
    }
)
Default Base Currency
üöß
The default API base currency is always United States Dollars (USD). It's not currently possible to set another default base for your entire account, so if (for example) you always need rates in GBP, you‚Äôll need to always add &base=GBP to your API requests.

Get Specific Currencies ('symbols')
By default, the API returns rates for all currencies, but if you need to minimise transfer size, you can request a limited subset of exchange rates, where available, by setting the symbols (alias: currencies) parameter in your request.

üëç
Requesting specific currency rates is available for all clients, including Free subscribers.

We recommend using this parameter as much as possible to reduce response weight, which can improve performance, especially on mobile devices and low-bandwidth connections.

Symbols (currencies) should be provided as a comma-separated list of standard 3-letter ISO currency codes (see our list of available API currencies if in doubt), in any order.

Basic Request & Response
Append the symbols query parameter to your API request, along with the comma-separated list of 3-digit ISO currency codes or symbols you require (in any order), like so:

HTTP
jQuery

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=[[app:app_id]]
    &symbols=GBP,EUR,AED,CAD
The response format is exactly the same as the standard API response, with all rates in the rates object given relative to 1 standard unit of your requested base currency:

JSON

{
    disclaimer: "https://openexchangerates.org/terms/",
    license: "https://openexchangerates.org/license/",
    "timestamp": 1424127600,
    "base": "USD",
    "rates": {
        "AED": 3.67295,
        "CAD": 0.99075,
        "EUR": 0.793903,
        "GBP": 0.62885
    }
}
The response format is the same as the standard API response, with only your requested currencies delivered in the rates object.

Basic Code Samples
jQuery
Others...

$.get('https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json', {app_id: '[[app:app_id]]', symbols: 'QAR,RUB,SEK'}, function(data) {
    console.log("1 US Dollar equals " + data.rates.SEK + " Swedish Krona");
});
Combining Parameters
Requesting specific currency symbols can be combined with other API parameters, such as changing the base currency (base) and JSONP callbacks (callback) ‚Äì for example:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/historical/2015-02-16.json
    ?app_id=[[app:app_id]]
    &base=CAD
    &symbols=AUD,GBP,EUR
    &callback=someFunctionName
The response will combine your parameters:

JSON

someFunctionName(
{
    disclaimer: "https://openexchangerates.org/terms/",
    license: "https://openexchangerates.org/license/",
    timestamp: 1424127600,
    base: "CAD",
    rates: {
            AUD: 1.032828,
            EUR: 0.706867,
            GBP: 0.522328,
        }
    }
)
The parameter is also available (and strongly recommended) for Time Series requests.

Bid-Ask Prices ('show_bid_ask')
Request bid, ask and mid prices for all currencies, where available.

We calculate the best available (top of the book) buy and sell prices for the majority of currencies we offer, and provide these instead of a single midpoint rate when you use the show_bid_ask API parameter.

Using this parameter replaces the regular results, so that instead of a midpoint currency value for each returned currency symbol, you will receive an object containing ask, bid, and mid.

Currently available for clients of our VIP Platinum tier. Please contact us if you would like to test out this feature.

Request 'Bid-Ask' Rates
Append the show_bid_ask query parameter to your latest.json, historical/ or spot.json API request, like so:

HTTP
jQuery

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
    &show_bid_ask=1
The response format is the same as the standard API response, except that instead of a single (midpoint) value for each returned currency symbol, you will now receive an object containing bid, ask and mid for each currency where these are available*:

JSON

{
  "disclaimer": "...",
  "license": "...",
  "timestamp": 1501084644,
  "base": "USD",
  "rates": {
    "AED": {
      "bid": 3.67229,
      "ask": 3.67378,
      "mid": 3.673035
    },
    "AFN": {
      "bid": 68.399726,
      "ask": 68.690659,
      "mid": 68.545193
    },
    /* ... */
}
*For some currencies, we do not currently provide bid and ask prices. In such cases, or if we don't have bid and ask prices available for a given currency or data, we will not return them for that symbol.

You will still receive mid, but bid and ask will not be included.

$.get('https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json', {app_id: 'YOUR_APP_ID', show_bid_ank: 1}, function(data) {
    console.log("USD/GBP 'bid' price: " + data.rates.GBP.bid);
    console.log("USD/GBP 'ask' price: " + data.rates.GBP.ask);
});
Combining Parameters
The show_bid_ask parameter can be combined with any other parameters available, such as base and symbols, and historical queries.

Get Specific Currencies ('symbols')
Alternative Rates ('show_alternative')

Alternative Rates ('show_alternative')
Certain alternative rates aren't suitable for our primary API endpoints, but have been commonly requested by our clients (such as Dicom, Dipro and black market rates for Venezuelan Bol√¨var, and a variety of digital currencies).

You may now request latest and historical rates for unofficial, black market and alternative digital currencies by adding a simple API parameter onto your request.

Please contact us if you would like to receive data for an alternative rate or digital currency that we do not currently provide.

You may add data for all supported unofficial, black market and alternative digital currencies by adding the show_alternative query parameter to your API request. The list of supported 'alternative' currencies is here.

Some of these rates are due to be added to the primary API (such as LTC/Litecoin and ETH/Ether), while others will remain available only through the show_alternative API parameter (such as VEF_DIPRO and VEF_DICOM).

üìò
Alternative currencies data are available for all clients, and the feature is currently in stable beta. The request and response format may change and currencies may be added and removed (but we'll post an update via our Status Page whenever this happens).

You may contact us with any feedback or questions about this feature and the returned rates at support@openexchangerates.org.

üöß
Future inclusion of ETH and LTC symbols in primary API results
In early 2018, we intend to merge ETH (Ethereum) and LTC (Litecoin) with our 'primary' API results. This means they'll be available to all users, without using the special show_alternative parameter.

If you rely on ETH or LTC data in your integration and you use the show_alternative parameter to fetch them, then you will still receive them after this change, exactly as before and will not need to change your integration.

However, if you use the (now deprecated) only_alternative parameter to fetch LTC or ETH, you will need to modify your integration to use show_alternative instead. After this change, only_alternative will no longer return ETH or LTC. We will send an email update ahead of this change, giving you ample time to make any needed adjustments.

Please contact us if you need any help or support making this change, or have any questions about these rates.

Request Latest 'Alternative' Rates
Append the show_alternative query parameter to your latest.json, historical/ or time-series.json API request, like so:

HTTP
jQuery

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
    &show_alternative=1
The response format is exactly the same as the standard API response, with additional rates added to the rates object:

JSON

{
    disclaimer: "https://openexchangerates.org/terms/",
    license: "https://openexchangerates.org/license/",
    "timestamp": 1500652863,
    "base": "USD",
    "rates": {
        "AED": 3.673018,
        /* ... */
        "VEF_BLKMKT": 8570.78,
        "VEF_DICOM": 2700,
        "VEF_DIPRO": 10,
        /* ... */
    }
}
Each new symbol can be set as the base currency, if available in the returned data set (default is USD).

NB: Only currencies in the returned list can be set as a base currency.

üìò
Alternative rate symbols are not limited to standard international 3-letter ISO codes, and may have fewer or more characters (such as "VEF_BLKMKT").
You can find a full list via the currencies.json route (see below), and our list of supported currencies.

Get List Of Available Alternative Currencies
The show_alternative query option can be added to requests for our currencies.json endpoint, to include alternative rate symbols and full currency names:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json
    ?show_alternative=1
You can view a list of supported alternative rates here.

    console.log("1 USD equals " + data.rates.DOGE + " DogeCoin.");
    console.log("1 USD equals " + data.rates.VEF_BLKMKT + " Venezuelan Bolivar on the black market.");
});
Combining Parameters
Alternative, digital and black-market rates can be combined with all other parameters on the latest.json endpoint:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID
    &base=LTC
    &show_alternative=1
    &symbols=ETH,VEF,VEF_DIPRO,VEF_DICOM,VEF_BLKMKT,BTC,NEM
    &prettyprint=0
Changes to Alternative rates parameter
üöß
What happened to "experimental" rates?
On 31st January 2017, we updated the terminology for this API option from show_experimental to show_alternative, to reflect the fact that these currencies are not generally considered to be experimental. The parameter functions exactly as before.

Although we will continue to support the legacy 'experimental' syntax, we strongly recommend updating your integration to the new parameter name.

üöß
What happened to the "only_alternative" / "only_experimental" parameter?
The only_alternative (and previously, only_experimental) parameters enabled you to see only alternative rates in your API response (excluding the standard list).

This parameter has been deprecated as of July 2017, and may be removed in future. We strongly advise using show_alternative instead, and using the symbols parameter to limit the returned results.

Bid-Ask Prices ('show_bid_ask')
Minified Response ('prettyprint')

Minified Response ('prettyprint')
All of our API requests can be minified or pretty-printed.

By default, the Open Exchange Rates API returns responses in human-readable (pretty-printed) format, with indentation and line breaks.

If you prefer to minify your API responses to save bandwidth, you can use the prettyprint query parameter with any valid API route.

The data will be returned with unnecessary whitespace removed, but otherwise exactly the same.

Example Query
Request:

HTTP
jQuery

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=[[app:app_id]]
    &prettyprint=0
Response:

JSON

{"disclaimer": "[...]","license":"[...]","timestamp":1453623028,"base":"USD","rates":{"AED":3.67289,"AFN":68.580001,"ALL":127.189901,/* ... */}}
üìò
Please note: because the default value is 1 ('true'), you need to specify prettyprint=0 to receive minified responses.
Updated 3 months ago

Alternative Rates ('show_alternative')
JSONP Requests ('callback')

JSONP Requests ('callback')
All of our API routes/endpoints support JSONP callbacks.

If you need to receive your API response wrapped inside a JSONP callback function, you can use the callback query parameter with any valid API route. The data will be returned wrapped in the callback function you specify.

The callback value can be any valid JavaScript method name.

The entire JSON API response will be delivered wrapped in the requested callback function.

Example JSONP Query
Request URL:

HTTP

https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json
    ?app_id=[[app:app_id]]
    &callback=myCallbackFunction
JSONP Response:

ETags / Cache Control
Did this page help you?
Table of Contents

ETags / Cache Control
ETags (‚ÄúIf-None-Match‚Äù) provide a simple method of saving bandwidth, by checking whether the rates have been updated since your last request.

If the data have not changed since your previous request, you can fallback to a cached copy, and your API response will be under 0.2kb (instead of the standard 2‚Äì4kb response). If the rates have changed, you'll receive the latest data as usual.

It's easier than it sounds - here's a step-by-step guide to prove it!

From the article on Etags:

An ETag ["Entity Tag"] is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are similar to fingerprints, and they can be quickly compared to determine if two versions of a resource are the same or not.
-- Wikipedia

1. Store the latest API response
Each time you make a request to the Open Exchange Rates API, the HTTP response headers will include an ETag and a Date.

The Etag is a unique identifier for the data returned in the response, and the Date is the time at which the data was last modified.

Example:


Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2012 14:48:28 GMT
ETag: "4e6acdd9fea30c21d9bdf1925afbf846"
After receiving your API response, cache the entire response somewhere (e.g. to a file, database or in memory), along with the values for the ETag and Date headers.

2. Add the "If-None-Match" header
Next time you make a request to the same API URL, add the If-None-Match header, with the value set to the ETag you grabbed from the previous request, wrapped in double quotation '"' marks.

You also need to send an If-Modified-Since header, which will be the Date value from the last successful request.

Using the example above, your two request headers would look like this:


If-None-Match: "4e6acdd9fea30c21d9bdf1925afbf846"
If-Modified-Since: Thu, 20 Dec 2012 14:48:28 GMT
3. If not modified, use cached data
If the data have not been updated since your last request, the response status code will be 304 ‚Äì Not Modified, and no data will be returned.

You can now safely use the cached API response from your previous successful request.

4. If updated, cache the new response
If the rates have changed since your last request, the latest data will returned as usual, along with new ETag and `Date`` headers.

Repeat Step 1.

üìò
Please note: Although ETags help reduce bandwidth for your users, all API requests still count towards your monthly request allowance ‚Äì even if the data has not changed since your last request.
Further Examples
This post on the Facebook Developers blog contains a solid run-down of ETags.
