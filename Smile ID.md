Document Verification
Document Verification
Overview
The Document Verification product lets you verify the authenticity of Identity documents submitted by your users and confirm that the document actually belongs to the user by comparing the user's selfie to the photo on the document. To run a document verification job, we require:

A selfie of the user

An image of the document

The country of issuance (this must be one of our supported document type and country, all supported documents and countries is listed in the next section)

Key Features:
Document Authentication: Verify the authenticity of identity documents by checking security features, MRZ and barcodes.

User Authentication: Confirm that the submitted document belongs to the user by comparing their selfie with the photo on the document. This step ensures that the person presenting the document is indeed its rightful owner.

Global Coverage: Document Verification supports a wide range of document types and countries. You can rely on our extensive database of supported documents and countries to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Supported Documents
For the full list of supported documents, please refer to the supported continents in our documentation.

Integration Options
Available via the Rest API, Mobile, Server to Server and Web SDK.

We highly recommend using document verification product via the mobile SDKs or Web SDK (on a mobile device). This is because we require high image resolutions in order for our machine to check the authenticity of the document. You can still use document verification via the other integration options but you will be responsible for capturing the images to the required specification.

Image Specifications
Please ensure that the orientation of your document images matches the way information is printed on the document. For example, if the document is meant to be read vertically(portrait) like a passport, do not rotate the image to a horizontal (landscape) orientation.

To check the authenticity of the document, we require high-resolution images. The image should be cropped to include the entire document with minimal background.

The following are the minimum specifications we require for the document image:

The minimum resolution on the horizontal (longer) side of credit card-sized ID cards should be 1500 pixels.

Minimum resolution on the horizontal (longer) side of passports should be 2200 pixels.

The total Image size should be at least 600KB but no more than 10MB.

To get the best results on document verification, we recommend the document image meets the following criteria:

Ensure the image is not tightly cropped. All edges of the ID document should be visible.

The face in the ID photo should be visible.

The document should be placed on a flat, non-white surface for the capture.

If the document contains an MRZ code, ensure no part of the code is covered by a finger or is cut off in the image.

Avoid fingers covering any part of the document.

Ensure no glare or bright light (flash) obstructs information on the document.

All text on the document must be readable after capture.

Uploading the Job Payload
To perform a job, Smile ID requires a Zip file that contains the following information:

images - images are ID document photo (bearer's face must be visible), selfie and liveness images (optional)

Info.json file - the structure of the info.json file is detailed below

The Zip file must have the same name as the file_name specified while making a job request (prep upload). In the case of the example request above, the filename will be attachments.zip.

Request Type: PUT

Environment
URL
Sandbox

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

Production

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

The request body will be of type binary (the zip file)

Info.json file
The info.json file contains the selfie and ID card images required to process the document verification job. The images can either be parsed inline as a base64 encoded string or the image files themselves can be zipped with the info.json file. Only .jpg file type is supported.

The structure of the info.json file is detailed below

Parameter
Description
package_information

This contains information about the rest api you’re calling. We recommend you use the following as the package_information:

"package_information":

{

"apiVersion": {

"buildNumber": 0,

"majorVersion": 2,

"minorVersion": 0

}
}

id_info

The country and id type you want to verify. The uploaded ID card image must match the country and id type you specify in this json object. To view the list of supported documents check the supported documents section on this page.

"id_info":

{

"country":"<country code e.g. KE>",

"id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. NATIONAL_ID>"

}

⚠️ id_type is optional. If a job is submitted without id_type and the machine can't classify the document, we will reject the job.

images

The images required for the document verification job. There are 3 image types that can be uploaded:

Selfie - a single coloured selfie image of the user.

Liveness images (optional) - 8 colour images of the user’s face captured while the user was prepping to take the selfie image (it’s recommended you use either our mobile SDKs or Javascript SDK to capture the liveness images).

ID card image - a single front image of the user’s ID card or two images (front and back of ID card) if the back of the ID card contains vital information such as MRZ code.

The images can be added as base64 encoded strings or the image files themselves can be added to the zip and the filename specified in the info.json.

{

"image_type_id": “varies based on image type and type of upload either base64 string or filename. Read more on image types in FAQs”,

"image": "<base64 string of image>",

"file_name": "<name of file in the zip that will be uploaded>"

}


Depending on the image_type_id one of the other parameters (image or file_name) will be an empty string (“”)

Info.json Example
The zip file contains the info.json file only (if images are inline i.e. supplied as base64 encoded strings) or both an info.json file and image files (if the image files themselves are uploaded).

Example zip file and info.json when images are inline (i.e. base64 encoded strings)


The zip file contains only the info.json file and no image files.

Evaluating the Results
Actions performed on the product are not completed at the same time, so we send results to your callback endpoint when they are ready. Also, if the Smile ID system can not automatically make a decision on an action it is passed to our human reviewers, the system decision is sent via callback once the reviewers make a final decision.

The Document Verification can fail for multiple reasons:

A spoof was detected on the submitted selfie - if we believe the selfie has been tampered with or is a picture of a picture, the document verification will fail.

The submitted selfie does not match the face on the document - if the selfie and face on the document do not match, the document verification job will fail.

The OCR extracted information and the decoded MRZ or barcode information do not match e.g. name encoded in the MRZ does not match the name that can be seen on the document.

The document image or selfie is blurry.

Some known visible security features on the document are missing e.g. the coat of arms on a Nigerian driver’s license.

The id type specified by the user does not match our system’s classification of the document type.

Result Codes and Result Texts
Result codes details what the current (or final) result of a job is. Result Codes for all jobs fall into one of two categories:

Approved (or Pass)
This means that all applicable Actions passed and the overall job was approved.

Rejected (or Fail)
This means that one or more of the applicable Actions for job failed, and thus, the overall job was rejected according to Smile ID standards.

General Failures Result Codes and Texts
This means no further processing is possible on the job. General failures occur when a job could not be submitted due to a logical/technical issue. These jobs do not show up in the portal and do not have a Smile Job ID.

* If a job is approved with attention, we suggest that you determine the appropriate course of action in your system by considering the reason for the attention.

Running in Sandbox
Document verification can be tested in our sandbox environment. However, you will get a simulated response. In sandbox, the document verification job is processed as described below:

The selfie is compared to the photo on the identity document, if both images do not match the document verification job fails

The authenticity of the document is not confirmed and we will always return the document as been valid

The values you parse in id_type and country are not checked with the supported countries and ids

Performing Document Verification with a Registered User’s Selfie
Document verification can be performed on users that have been previously enrolled successfully through an Biometric KYC or SmartSelfie™ Authentication - User Registration.

When performing document verification for an already enrolled user, you do not need to submit a selfie in the info.json file. You only send the user_id of the user, the image of the document ID, and set the flag use_enrolled_image to true during prep upload.

Uploading the Job Payload
To perform a job, Smile ID requires a Zip file that contains the following information:

ID card image

Info.json file - the structure of the info.json file is detailed below

The Zip file must have the same name as the file_name specified while making a job request (prep upload). In the case of the example request above, the filename will be attachments.zip.

Request Type: PUT

Environment
URL
Sandbox

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

Production

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

The request body will be of type binary (the zip file)

Info.json file
The info.json file contains the ID card image required to process the document verification job. The image can either be parsed inline as a base64 encoded string or the image files themselves can be zipped with the info.json file. Only .jpg file type is supported.

The structure of the info.json file is detailed below

Parameter
Description
package_information

This contains information about the rest api you’re calling. We recommend you use the following as the package_information:

"package_information":

{

"apiVersion": {

"buildNumber": 0,

"majorVersion": 2,

"minorVersion": 0
}

}

id_info

The country and id type you want to verify. The uploaded ID card image must match the country and id type you specify in this json object. To view the list of supported documents check the supported documents section on this page.

"id_info":

{

"country":"<country code e.g. KE>",

"id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. NATIONAL_ID>"

}

images

The image required for the document verification job. There is only one image type required, since the job will use a registered selfie:

ID card image - a single front image of the user’s ID card or two images (front and back of the ID card) if the back of the ID card contains vital information such as MRZ code.

The images can be added as base64 encoded strings or the image files themselves can be added to the zip and the filename specified in the info.json.

{

"image_type_id": “varies based on image type and type of upload either base64 string or filename. Read more on image types in FAQs”,

"image": "<base64 string of image>",

"file_name": "<name of file in the zip that will be uploaded>"

}


Depending on the image_type_id one of the other parameters (image or file_name) will be an empty string (“”)

Info.json Example
The zip file contains the info.json file only (if images are inline i.e. supplied as base64 encoded strings) or both an info.json file and image files (if the image files themselves are uploaded).

Example zip file and info.json when images are inline (i.e. base64 encoded strings)


The zip file contains only the info.json file and no image files.
The content of the info.json file below:

Copy
{
  "package_information":
  {
    "apiVersion": {
      "buildNumber": 0,
      "majorVersion": 2,
      "minorVersion": 0
    }
  },
  "id_info":
  {
    "country":"<country code e.g. NG>",
    "id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. PASSPORT>"
  },
  "images": [
    {
      <Use this for the ID card>
      "Image_type_id": 3,
      "image": "iVBORw0KGlDQ1BJQ0MgUHJvZmlsZQAASImVVw- - -truncated base64 string",
      "file_name": ""
    }
  ]
}

The zip file contains the info.json file and the ID card image.
The content of the info.json file below:

Copy
{
  "package_information":
  {
    "apiVersion": {
      "buildNumber": 0,
      "majorVersion": 2,
      "minorVersion": 0
    }
  },
  "id_info":
  {
    "country":"<country code e.g. NG>",
    "id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. PASSPORT>"
  },
  "images": [
    {
      <Use this for the ID card>
      "Image_type_id": 1,
      "image": "",
      "file_name": "ID.jpg"
    }
  ]
}

PRODUCTS
For Individuals (KYC)
SmartSelfie™ Authentication
Overview
SmartSelfie™ Authentication verifies a returning user’s identity by comparing a newly captured selfie to a reference image already registered in Smile ID's system. A reference selfie can come from a previous successful Biometric KYC, Document Verification, or SmartSelfie™ Compare job.

SmartSelfie™ Authentication requires a pre-existing reference selfie. If the user hasn’t completed any of the jobs mentioned above, please perform a SmartSelfie™ Registration first to capture and register their selfie.
Integration Options
Available on Mobile, Server-to-Server libraries and Rest API.

Performing an Authentication
Prerequisite
To perform SmartSelfie™ Authentication, you must provide a user_id that has already been used in a successful job where a reference selfie was captured.

This means the user must have previously completed one of the following:

Biometric KYC

Document Verification

SmartSelfie™ Compare

If no such job exists for the user, please register them first by performing a SmartSelfie™ Registration.

Once you have a valid user_id from one of these jobs, you can follow the instructions below to authenticate the user.

Evaluating the Results
Actions performed on the product are not completed at the same time, so we send results to your callback as they are ready. Also, if the Smile ID system can not automatically make a decision on an action it is passed to human reviewers, the system decision is sent via callback pending the time the reviewers make a final decision.

You can get the results of the job anytime by using the Job Status endpoint. Read more about the Job Status endpoint in the Utilities section of any integration option of your choice.

How Smile ID Processes the Job
Action

Description

Proof of life & spoof detection

Performed on user submitted selfie

Selfie compare

Selfie is compared to photo on User's photo on file in Smile ID

Result Codes and Result Texts
Result codes details what the current (or final) result of a job is. Result Codes for all jobs fall into one of three categories:

Approved (or Pass)
This means that all applicable Actions passed and the overall job was approved.

Provisionally Approved
This means that the job is awaiting a human review, or that a human review was inconclusive or that part of a job passed but another part was unable to be completed.
You can treat these jobs as Approved or you handle them based on the Result Code.
Please note a Pure Provisional result is a provisionally approved job, but one in which the image comparison Action was provisionally approved but the identity validation Action failed or could not return data. Also note, a Pending Approval result is a custom Strict setting where the user cannot progress in the system without a human review being completed on the Pending job.

Rejected (or Fail)
This means that one or more of the applicable Actions for job failed, and thus, the overall job was rejected according to Smile ID standards.

General Failures Result Codes and Texts
This means no further processing is possible on the job. General failures occur when a job could not be submitted due to a logical/technical issue. These jobs do not show up in the portal and do not have a Smile Job ID.

Prefix for error codes may also be 23xx or 24xx

SmartSelfie™ Registration
If the user doesn’t have a reference selfie on file, you can perform a SmartSelfie™ Registration to capture and save their selfie for future authentication attempts. During this process, we will also perform liveness checks before registering the selfie.

To complete the registration, you’ll need to provide:

A clear selfie of the user. We recommend using our Mobile or Web SDKs to capture a high-quality SmartSelfie™ (selfie and liveness images).

A new user_id. This unique identifier will be required when performing future authentications for the user.

Evaluating the Results
Actions performed on the product are not completed at the same time, so we send results to your callback as they are ready. Also, if the Smile ID system can not automatically make a decision on an action it is passed to human reviewers, the system decision is sent via callback pending the time the reviewers make a final decision.

You can get the results of the job anytime by using the Job Status endpoint. Read more about the Job Status endpoint in the Utilities section of any integration option of your choice.

How Smile ID Processes the Job
Action

Description

Proof of life & spoof detection

Performed on user submitted selfie

Result Codes and Result Texts
Result codes details what the current (or final) result of a job is. Result Codes for all jobs fall into one of three categories:

Approved (or Pass)
This means that all applicable Actions passed and the overall job was approved.

Provisionally Approved
This means that the job is awaiting a human review, or that a human review was inconclusive or that part of a job passed but another part was unable to be completed.
You can treat these jobs as Approved or you handle them based on the Result Code.
Please note a Pure Provisional result is a provisionally approved job, but one in which the image comparison Action was provisionally approved but the identity validation Action failed or could not return data. Also note, a Pending Approval result is a custom Strict setting where the user cannot progress in the system without a human review being completed on the Pending job.

Rejected (or Fail)
This means that one or more of the applicable Actions for job failed, and thus, the overall job was rejected according to Smile ID standards.

General Failures Result Codes and Texts
This means no further processing is possible on the job. General failures occur when a job could not be submitted due to a logical/technical issue. These jobs do not show up in the portal and do not have a Smile Job ID.

Prefix for error codes may also be 23xx or 24xx

PRODUCTS
For Individuals (KYC)
SmartSelfie™ Compare
The SmartSelfie™ Compare product lets you match and authenticate a genuine user's selfie with an existing photo on file.

Overview
The SmartSelfie™ Compare product lets you match and authenticate a genuine user's selfie with an existing photo on file.

In one step, you submit both:
1. the user's selfie and liveness images and
2. the image on file (eg. government authority image).

With SmartSelfie™ Compare, a user will enrolled (registered) and Authenticated in one go instead of the two step process of SmartSelfie™ Authentication .

Integration Options
Available on Rest API.

You can capture face images using the mobile and web SDKs and then submit via the REST APIs. To do this, see

Using the SmartSelfie™ Compare Product
Follow the steps below to perform a SmartSelfie™ Compare:

Make a job request that has your selfie and comparison photo

Upload the job requirements

Evaluate your result

Making a Request
This API is designed to be more RESTFUL to ensure standardised consistency and stateless API implementation. Hence, it differs from our existing biometric products in two main ways:

It uses header-based authentication instead of body-based authentication. This means you will now add your authorisation params (timestamp, partner-id, and signature) in the HTTP-header. This

The responses are always synchronous. You can add a callback and recieve responses in the previous smile format. The synchronous nature of these responses means there are NO HUMAN REVIEWS at the submission stage. Hence there will be no PENDING or PROVISIONAL RESULTS.

Signing your API Request
Using Signature
If you use one of the supplied SDKs, there is no reason to use the code in the following section as the signature can be generated by calling the generate_signature function.

The generated signature has to be passed as a string in your request.

Overview
To communicate with our system we require a unique signature on each request to ensure that both parties are who they say they are. This signature should be generated at the time of the job submission. To calculate your signature, you will need your partner ID and API Key for Signature, both of which are available on the portal.

API Key for Signature

You can find and generate your an API key here. The key is unique to each environment, so you will need a different key for the sandbox and production environments. You can rotate your API key any time, however your previous key will be immediately disabled.

Partner ID
You will need to know your partner ID, to create the signature. Your partner ID can be viewed when logged into the portal. To calculate your signature you will need to input your partner ID as a string, as explained below

Your partner ID: 085

String Value of your partner ID: "085"

Generating the signature
Follow the steps below to generate your signature

Create a timestamp in an ISO date format

Create a new hmac-sha256 hash function using Signature API Key.

Update the function message with timestamp created in 1, your partner Id, and "sid_request" string

Base64 encode the encrypted hash

Example code for creating the signature

Ruby
Node.js
Python
PHP
Java
C#
Go
Copy
require 'openssl'
require 'time'
require 'base64'

timestamp = Time.now.to_s
api_key = '<API-Key>'
partner_id = '<partner-id>'
hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.new(api_key, 'sha256')
hmac.update(timestamp) hmac.update(partner_id)
hmac.update("sid_request")

signature = Base64.strict_encode64(hmac.digest())
Reminder: You must pass the signature as a string in your request.
Your timestamp should be a string in the ISO 8601 format "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.fffZ"

Confirming an incoming signature
To verify the authenticity of the response received from your callback as genuinely originating from Smile ID, you can confirm the returned signature and timestamp. The sample codes provided below can be used to confirm the signature in the request:

Example code for confirming the signature

Ruby
Node.js
Python
PHP
Java
C#
Go
Copy
require 'openssl'
require 'time'
require 'base64'

# Example inputs - replace these with actual received values
# The signature received in the callback response
received_signature = ""
# The actual timestamp received in the callback response
received_timestamp = ""

# Your partner ID
partner_id = ""
# Your api key for the environment in concern (sandbox / production)
api_key = ""

# Function to verify the signature
def confirm_signature(received_signature, received_timestamp, partner_id, api_key)
  hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.new(api_key, 'sha256')
  hmac.update(received_timestamp)
  hmac.update(partner_id)
  hmac.update("sid_request")

  generated_signature = Base64.strict_encode64(hmac.digest)

  received_signature == generated_signature
end

# print out a confirmation status
is_signature_valid = confirm_signature(received_signature, received_timestamp, partner_id, api_key)
puts "Is the signature valid? #{is_signature_valid}"
Reminder: You must pass the received signature, received timestamp, partner id and api key as strings.

Postman Collection
Overview
Smile ID offers a Postman collection as a convenient way to test our Rest API endpoints without having to write code. Postman is a standalone tool that lets you test API functionality by sending requests and receiving response, Postman handles the HTTP client infrastructure code. This article is a comprehensive step-by-step guide to setting up your Postman and Smile ID Postman Collection, to enable you explore and test Smile ID Rest APIs.

The Smile ID Postman Collection URL is here and the import method in Postman is Link.

Getting Started
Install Postman

Import the Smile ID Postman Collection

Configure Smile ID Postman Collection

1. Installing Postman
Postman is available on Linux, Mac and Windows. The tool can be downloaded from the Postman website. Launch the tool after installation, you should see a user interface similar to the one below:


2. Importing the Smile ID Postman Collection

Click on Import

Select Link as the import option

Copy and paste the Smile ID Postman Collection Url in the Enter a URL field

Click Continue to import the collection

We have named the collection Smile ID Product Endpoints.

3. Configuring Smile ID Postman Collection
To use the collection, you need to specify your partner_id , signature api_key and callback_url in the collection variables.

You can get both your partner_id and signature api_key in your Smile ID portal. Ensure you copy the api_key of the environment you intend to test the collection in.

To quickly see and examine how Smile ID responses returned to your callback looks, you can generate a free webhook url using the Webhook Tester tool. You can use the url you generate as yourcallback_url.

Setting the Collection Variables

Click the options icon ... next to the Smile ID Product Endpoints collection

Select Edit

Select Variables to edit the collection variables

Set your partner ID in the initial value field of the variable partner_id

Set your signature api key in the initial value field of the variable api_key

Set your callback url in the initial value field of the variable callback_url

Click on Reset All

Click Save to store the values you inputted for each of the variables

Ensure you leave all other variables unchanged

You do not need to set the signature and timestamp variables as there are scripts we have added in the collection that calculates them automatically. You can generate your signature and timestamp using any of our provided sample codes, in the language of your choice.

Using the Smile ID Postman Collection
Understanding the Structure of the Collection
The collection contains sub-folders, each representing a Smile ID product. Within the sub-folders are the sets of requests to run a successful job for that product.

Testing Sandbox or Production Requests
You can run both Sandbox and Production requests using the Smile ID postman collection. The base urls for the Sandbox and Production environments have been pre-set as variables in the collection.

Test Sandbox Requests

Set the base_url variable in the request url section to {{sandbox}}

Test Production Requests

Set the base_url variable in the request url section to {{prod}}

Running a Request

Choose your Product of choice and select the first endpoint that is not marked OPT

Navigate to Body in the Postman interface

Set the appropriate values for each of the keys that are contained in the body section of the endpoint. Do not set values for any key with a {{xxxx}} in the value section as these are set automatically by the collection. For ID information, not all the keys in the body of the endpoint are required, you can get the list of required keys per ID Type here.

Switch to the environment you want to run tests in - Sandbox is {{sandbox}} while Production is {{prod}}

Click on Send to send your request

Your response is either displayed on Postman or in the cases of products that require a callback_url to your callback url.

Running the Requests in the Correct Order
It is important that you run the requests in the order in which they are arranged in the collection sub-folders, since some of the data returned by one request may be used by the next.

Any request marked OPT e.g. OPT`` Request Name is optional and that request can be skipped.

Rate Limits
SmileID will track how many requests come in from a customer for a specific ID Number (within an ID Type for a particular Country). Excessive requests for the same ID Number over a period of time will cause us to block requests for this Number until the rate limit resets. Typically we see excessive requests for the same ID Number due to fraud or mis-configured integrations so we deny those excessive requests on behalf of our customers.

Our current rate limits per unique ID number are: a total of 30 requests, where each request comes within 3 days of each other. 3 days after a request comes in, the limit for that unique ID number will be reset. SmileID reserves the right to alter these limits as required at any time.

Blocked requests will receive a 429 response with the 2222 error code included in the body and This ID number has been blocked due to multiple submissions. Please use the designated endpoint to reactivate it. as the error message.

If you find genuine requests are being blocked then you can make a request to the id_number_rate_limit_reset endpoint to clear the rate limit and immediately allow requests for that ID Number to be processed normally.

This section is only useful if you are not using one of our Web API core packages since they all contain a get_job_status method.

The job status API returns information about a job, including its completion status, whether or not it was successful, optionally the complete history (all information sent to the callback , and also optionally, a signed link to the images captured during that job.

Unlike the callback, where results are asynchronous and we POST to your server, the job status API is implemented on our servers and you make POST requests to it. Just like any other call to our servers, we use an encrypted signature to verify that you are the sender of the request, and the response will include a signature created by us for verification. You can find instructions on how to sign the request in the api access portion of our documentation or use the generate_signature method in one of our server -to-server library.

PRODUCTS
For Individuals (KYC)
Document Verification
Document Verification
Overview
The Document Verification product lets you verify the authenticity of Identity documents submitted by your users and confirm that the document actually belongs to the user by comparing the user's selfie to the photo on the document. To run a document verification job, we require:

A selfie of the user

An image of the document

The country of issuance (this must be one of our supported document type and country, all supported documents and countries is listed in the next section)

Key Features:
Document Authentication: Verify the authenticity of identity documents by checking security features, MRZ and barcodes.

User Authentication: Confirm that the submitted document belongs to the user by comparing their selfie with the photo on the document. This step ensures that the person presenting the document is indeed its rightful owner.

Global Coverage: Document Verification supports a wide range of document types and countries. You can rely on our extensive database of supported documents and countries to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Supported Documents
For the full list of supported documents, please refer to the supported continents in our documentation.

Integration Options
Available via the Rest API, Mobile, Server to Server and Web SDK.

We highly recommend using document verification product via the mobile SDKs or Web SDK (on a mobile device). This is because we require high image resolutions in order for our machine to check the authenticity of the document. You can still use document verification via the other integration options but you will be responsible for capturing the images to the required specification.

Image Specifications
Please ensure that the orientation of your document images matches the way information is printed on the document. For example, if the document is meant to be read vertically(portrait) like a passport, do not rotate the image to a horizontal (landscape) orientation.

To check the authenticity of the document, we require high-resolution images. The image should be cropped to include the entire document with minimal background.

The following are the minimum specifications we require for the document image:

The minimum resolution on the horizontal (longer) side of credit card-sized ID cards should be 1500 pixels.

Minimum resolution on the horizontal (longer) side of passports should be 2200 pixels.

The total Image size should be at least 600KB but no more than 10MB.

To get the best results on document verification, we recommend the document image meets the following criteria:

Ensure the image is not tightly cropped. All edges of the ID document should be visible.

The face in the ID photo should be visible.

The document should be placed on a flat, non-white surface for the capture.

If the document contains an MRZ code, ensure no part of the code is covered by a finger or is cut off in the image.

Avoid fingers covering any part of the document.

Ensure no glare or bright light (flash) obstructs information on the document.

All text on the document must be readable after capture.

Uploading the Job Payload
To perform a job, Smile ID requires a Zip file that contains the following information:

images - images are ID document photo (bearer's face must be visible), selfie and liveness images (optional)

Info.json file - the structure of the info.json file is detailed below

The Zip file must have the same name as the file_name specified while making a job request (prep upload). In the case of the example request above, the filename will be attachments.zip.

Request Type: PUT

Environment
URL
Sandbox

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

Production

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

The request body will be of type binary (the zip file)

Info.json file
The info.json file contains the selfie and ID card images required to process the document verification job. The images can either be parsed inline as a base64 encoded string or the image files themselves can be zipped with the info.json file. Only .jpg file type is supported.

The structure of the info.json file is detailed below

Parameter
Description
package_information

This contains information about the rest api you’re calling. We recommend you use the following as the package_information:

"package_information":

{

"apiVersion": {

"buildNumber": 0,

"majorVersion": 2,

"minorVersion": 0

}
}

id_info

The country and id type you want to verify. The uploaded ID card image must match the country and id type you specify in this json object. To view the list of supported documents check the supported documents section on this page.

"id_info":

{

"country":"<country code e.g. KE>",

"id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. NATIONAL_ID>"

}

⚠️ id_type is optional. If a job is submitted without id_type and the machine can't classify the document, we will reject the job.

images

The images required for the document verification job. There are 3 image types that can be uploaded:

Selfie - a single coloured selfie image of the user.

Liveness images (optional) - 8 colour images of the user’s face captured while the user was prepping to take the selfie image (it’s recommended you use either our mobile SDKs or Javascript SDK to capture the liveness images).

ID card image - a single front image of the user’s ID card or two images (front and back of ID card) if the back of the ID card contains vital information such as MRZ code.

The images can be added as base64 encoded strings or the image files themselves can be added to the zip and the filename specified in the info.json.

{

"image_type_id": “varies based on image type and type of upload either base64 string or filename. Read more on image types in FAQs”,

"image": "<base64 string of image>",

"file_name": "<name of file in the zip that will be uploaded>"

}


Depending on the image_type_id one of the other parameters (image or file_name) will be an empty string (“”)

Info.json Example
The zip file contains the info.json file only (if images are inline i.e. supplied as base64 encoded strings) or both an info.json file and image files (if the image files themselves are uploaded).

Example zip file and info.json when images are inline (i.e. base64 encoded strings)


The zip file contains only the info.json file and no image files.

Evaluating the Results
Actions performed on the product are not completed at the same time, so we send results to your callback endpoint when they are ready. Also, if the Smile ID system can not automatically make a decision on an action it is passed to our human reviewers, the system decision is sent via callback once the reviewers make a final decision.

The Document Verification can fail for multiple reasons:

A spoof was detected on the submitted selfie - if we believe the selfie has been tampered with or is a picture of a picture, the document verification will fail.

The submitted selfie does not match the face on the document - if the selfie and face on the document do not match, the document verification job will fail.

The OCR extracted information and the decoded MRZ or barcode information do not match e.g. name encoded in the MRZ does not match the name that can be seen on the document.

The document image or selfie is blurry.

Some known visible security features on the document are missing e.g. the coat of arms on a Nigerian driver’s license.

The id type specified by the user does not match our system’s classification of the document type.

Result Codes and Result Texts
Result codes details what the current (or final) result of a job is. Result Codes for all jobs fall into one of two categories:

Approved (or Pass)
This means that all applicable Actions passed and the overall job was approved.

Rejected (or Fail)
This means that one or more of the applicable Actions for job failed, and thus, the overall job was rejected according to Smile ID standards.

General Failures Result Codes and Texts
This means no further processing is possible on the job. General failures occur when a job could not be submitted due to a logical/technical issue. These jobs do not show up in the portal and do not have a Smile Job ID.

* If a job is approved with attention, we suggest that you determine the appropriate course of action in your system by considering the reason for the attention.

Running in Sandbox
Document verification can be tested in our sandbox environment. However, you will get a simulated response. In sandbox, the document verification job is processed as described below:

The selfie is compared to the photo on the identity document, if both images do not match the document verification job fails

The authenticity of the document is not confirmed and we will always return the document as been valid

The values you parse in id_type and country are not checked with the supported countries and ids

Performing Document Verification with a Registered User’s Selfie
Document verification can be performed on users that have been previously enrolled successfully through an Biometric KYC or SmartSelfie™ Authentication - User Registration.

When performing document verification for an already enrolled user, you do not need to submit a selfie in the info.json file. You only send the user_id of the user, the image of the document ID, and set the flag use_enrolled_image to true during prep upload.

Request Values
You need to perform two steps to use this product:

Make a request to Smile ID for a job to be performed

Uploading the Job Payload
To perform a job, Smile ID requires a Zip file that contains the following information:

ID card image

Info.json file - the structure of the info.json file is detailed below

The Zip file must have the same name as the file_name specified while making a job request (prep upload). In the case of the example request above, the filename will be attachments.zip.

Request Type: PUT

Environment
URL
Sandbox

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

Production

Upload URL you were supplied while making a Job Request

The request body will be of type binary (the zip file)

Info.json file
The info.json file contains the ID card image required to process the document verification job. The image can either be parsed inline as a base64 encoded string or the image files themselves can be zipped with the info.json file. Only .jpg file type is supported.

The structure of the info.json file is detailed below

Parameter
Description
package_information

This contains information about the rest api you’re calling. We recommend you use the following as the package_information:

"package_information":

{

"apiVersion": {

"buildNumber": 0,

"majorVersion": 2,

"minorVersion": 0
}

}

id_info

The country and id type you want to verify. The uploaded ID card image must match the country and id type you specify in this json object. To view the list of supported documents check the supported documents section on this page.

"id_info":

{

"country":"<country code e.g. KE>",

"id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. NATIONAL_ID>"

}

images

The image required for the document verification job. There is only one image type required, since the job will use a registered selfie:

ID card image - a single front image of the user’s ID card or two images (front and back of the ID card) if the back of the ID card contains vital information such as MRZ code.

The images can be added as base64 encoded strings or the image files themselves can be added to the zip and the filename specified in the info.json.

{

"image_type_id": “varies based on image type and type of upload either base64 string or filename. Read more on image types in FAQs”,

"image": "<base64 string of image>",

"file_name": "<name of file in the zip that will be uploaded>"

}


Depending on the image_type_id one of the other parameters (image or file_name) will be an empty string (“”)

Info.json Example
The zip file contains the info.json file only (if images are inline i.e. supplied as base64 encoded strings) or both an info.json file and image files (if the image files themselves are uploaded).

Example zip file and info.json when images are inline (i.e. base64 encoded strings)


The zip file contains only the info.json file and no image files.
The content of the info.json file below:

Copy
{
  "package_information":
  {
    "apiVersion": {
      "buildNumber": 0,
      "majorVersion": 2,
      "minorVersion": 0
    }
  },
  "id_info":
  {
    "country":"<country code e.g. NG>",
    "id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. PASSPORT>"
  },
  "images": [
    {
      <Use this for the ID card>
      "Image_type_id": 3,
      "image": "iVBORw0KGlDQ1BJQ0MgUHJvZmlsZQAASImVVw- - -truncated base64 string",
      "file_name": ""
    }
  ]
}
Example zip file and info.json when images are uploaded as files


The zip file contains the info.json file and the ID card image.
The content of the info.json file below:

Copy
{
  "package_information":
  {
    "apiVersion": {
      "buildNumber": 0,
      "majorVersion": 2,
      "minorVersion": 0
    }
  },
  "id_info":
  {
    "country":"<country code e.g. NG>",
    "id_type":"<smile ID type keyword e.g. PASSPORT>"
  },
  "images": [
    {
      <Use this for the ID card>
      "Image_type_id": 1,
      "image": "",
      "file_name": "ID.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
The return values, result codes and texts all remain the same as submitting the job with a selfie
