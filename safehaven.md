Introduction
Welcome to Safe Haven's API üôåüèæ

As a Safe Haven MFB customer, you can use our API to automate your business processes.

Our API can be used for a number of use cases such as :

Creating accounts
Managing beneficiaries
Making transfers
Viewing balances
This saves time and reduces costs and errors.

Here, you will get the documentation and resources to get you started with our easy to integrate APIs

The Safe Haven API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Safe Haven sandbox environment which does not interact with live banking networks while integrating our APIs.

To set up a sandbox account, go to https://online.sandbox.safehavenmfb.com.

Environments
The Safe Haven's API and dashboard are available on two environments:

Environment	Sandbox	Production
Dashboard URL	https://online.sandbox.safehavenmfb.com	https://online.safehavenmfb.com
API URL	https://api.sandbox.safehavenmfb.com	https://api.safehavenmfb.com

The sandbox environments allow you to easily test and simulate the available features without making any breaking changes.

Errors
Safe Haven uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Safe Haven's servers (these are rare).


Code	Description
200 - OK	Everything worked as expected.
400 - Bad Request	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 - Unauthorized	No valid API key was provided.
402 - Request Failed	The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403 - Forbidden	The API key doesn't have permission to perform the request.
404 - Not Found	The requested resource doesn't exist.
409 - Conflict	The request conflicts with another request.
429 - Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors	Something went wrong on Safe Haven's end. These are rare and if they happen, please contact us immediately.

Pagination
Safe Haven supports fetch of API resources like Accounts, Transfers. These endpoints share a common structure, taking at least these two parameters: page and limit. By default, the page is set to 0 and a limit of 25. You can fetch a maximum of 100 records at once. The resulting response will always include a pagination object with the total records count, the number of pages, the current page, and the limit set.
